## ðŸŒŠ Flow Cadence

### Core Cadence Contracts

- [AccountsPool](./cadence/contracts/AccountsPool.cdc) - A contract to let the agent account manage multiple child accounts.

| Contract | Testnet Address | Mainnet Address |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AccountsPool | [0x9f9cd022231f7a19](https://testnet.flowscan.io/contract/A.9f9cd022231f7a19.AccountsPool) | [0xa253e78e8971f273](https://www.flowscan.io/contract/A.a253e78e8971f273.AccountsPool) |

### Install / Add new Flow Cadence contracts dependencies

All Flow Cadence contracts dependencies should be installed to `flow.json` file.
To ensure development and deployment, you need to install all dependencies.

```bash
flow deps install
```

And if you want to add a new contract dependency, you can use the following command:

```bash
flow deps add mainnet://0xAddress.ContractName
```
